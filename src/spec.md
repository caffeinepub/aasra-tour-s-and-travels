# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide an in-app guide for purchasing a domain externally and configuring DNS to point a custom domain to the Aasra Cab Portal Internet Computer app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new “Domain Setup” page/route (e.g., `/domain-setup`) containing an English, step-by-step guide for buying a domain from any registrar and configuring DNS, including a clear note that domain purchase happens outside the app.
- Add a “Domain Setup” link in the footer navigation (Support or Quick Links) that routes to the new page via client-side navigation and matches existing UI styling (Tailwind + shadcn).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a new Domain Setup page from the footer to read clear English instructions for buying a domain elsewhere and setting DNS to connect it to the app.
