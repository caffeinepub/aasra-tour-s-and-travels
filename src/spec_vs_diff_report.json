The Domain Setup page content is partially visible in the diff; DNS configuration section is present but truncated, so full step-by-step DNS guidance cannot be fully verified from the provided excerpt. An unrelated project_state.json entry suggests a feature request to purchase a domain, which conflicts with the stated non-goals.",
